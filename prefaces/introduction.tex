Welcome to the Second Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Turkic Languages (SIGTURK 2026), held on March 29, 2026, in Rabat, Morocco. \\

This workshop received 28 submissions, out of which 20 papers were accepted as archival publications. Out of 20 accepted papers, we invited 8 papers as oral presentation during the workshop and 11 invited as poster presentations. \\

We are excited to bring together researchers working on NLP for Turkic languages and hope this workshop will foster further collaborations and advance the field. This year's participants made contributions by introducing new datasets and tools, presenting novel approaches to train LLMs and their evaluation, and diverse applications of models on Turkic languages. \\

We thank all authors for their submissions and the program committee for their thorough reviews. We look forward to engaging discussions and new connections made at SIGTURK 2026. \\
